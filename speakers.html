              As an undergraduate at Northeastern Claire realized the potential
              for cooperative housing in America, especially her home city of
              Boston, and how it can be used as an alternative model for
              equitable ownership. <br />
              Her startup BauBau emerged as an idea while she was studying
              in Berlin and working on a “baugruppen” building; this project
              required making a home for a diverse neighborhood of people
              consisting of young German families, the elderly and alone,
              Syrian refugees, and local students. <br />

Victoria believes healthcare can be improved by decentralization: moving away from healthcare “hubs” such as hospitals to bring care directly to patients. She has the idea to develop a self-test for sexually transmitted diseases.

                <br />
                Victoria became interested in this topic as an undergraduate intern working with oncologist Dr. Cesar Castro at Massachusetts General Hospital, where she studied human papillomavirus and its link to cervical cancer.

                <br />
                Victoria will be enrolling as a PhD candidate in fall 2019 and aspires to be a professor one day. She is happiest outdoors, and on weekends you can find her camping, hiking, roller blading, snowboarding, and ice skating.

His hobby is to to run “a lot”. Last November he ran the longest race he’s done so far: a 31 miles trail race but since he got lost 3 times in the woods, he ended up running 36+ miles. He still managed to finish 3rd place, running an hour faster than the previous course record.

                        <p class="mb-0">With only one single streaming, Carol has already generated significant interest in the local community by combining soft ambient folk with a complex vocal tone, fluttering harmonies, and searing lyricism. Her debut EP, Softest Destroyer, finds the poet and songwriter building sonic spaces that are lush and downy, radiating from the artist and nestling into sun-soaked corners. Softest Destroyer allows Carol’s floating vocals to drive a reflection on the self and what we sacrifice to those we care for. That sacrifice threads together the intricate layers, melding into the luscious ambiance built by producer Ruben Radlauer (Lady Pills and Dirt Buyer). <br />
