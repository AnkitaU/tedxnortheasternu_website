                    I used to model for an agency in Boston, and when on a shoot for a company I saw a hunched over Al Horford trying to discretely sneak into the practice facility wearing a bright red sweater with two men on either side of him in all of his 6'10" glory. Happy to say his failure in being secret gave me one of the coolest memories I've ever had!

                    I have been watching TEDx videos on YouTube since I was in middle school! They have been instrumental in my growth, both professionally and personally, by providing captivating perspectives on topics I am interested and unfamiliar with. Through the broadcasting of stories about people that I go to school with and people that I share a community with, TEDxNortheasternU provides such an eye-opening and thought-provoking experience that I decided I did not just want to sit and listen, but I wanted to be a part of the larger mission that TEDx has. My goal is to work behind the scenes of the action to encourage others in the community to take part in this influential experience.

                    I wanted to surround myself with people who are motivated, dedicated, and passionate about giving people a voice to share their story. Learning about each speaker’s experience and how it has shaped their view of the world is so inspiring and has made me more open-minded as a person. I wanted to be a part of an organization that encourages people to feel inspired and motivated to make a difference.
